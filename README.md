# Getting started
npm i to install dependecies
npm start to start project

# Reasons of choice
1. I decided to choose React just because I'm more familiar with it.
2. I choose Create React App to save some time on scaffolding and project configuration setup.
3. I choose to utilize Context API for the state management because it's completely solves the problem in this case and lets me to avoid extra dependencies, utilizing extra frameworks etc.
4. I choose to utilize Tyypescript in order to add a strong typings and types annotation. Which basically a kind of a static testing.
5. To solve problem with CORS I utilize embedded proxy. It was the simplest solution.
6. Because there is no way to somehow parameterize existed query URL i had to add Kelvin to Celsius converter.
